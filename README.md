# Abstract

Memory is a critical resource that enables complex computations within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The cost of using memory, designed to prevent its abuse, has not been revised since the inception of Ethereum. Efficiency gains from hardware advancements and client code optimizations warrants periodic repricing of this cost. By revising the pricing structure, it may be possible to reduce the costs associated with memory-intensive operations in the EVM, thereby making previously prohibitively expensive applications feasible.
